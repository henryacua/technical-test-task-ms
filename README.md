## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod

```

You can find files such as the docker-compose and the DB_SYNC environment variable which were added in order to facilitate the project build, with which you can quickly perform database migrations.

## Technical decisions

For the present project it was decided to choose a layered architecture that gives each folder a specific responsibility. is separated into "layers" that collaborate with each other

is separated into layers that collaborate with each other to distribute backend responsibilities.
These layers are divided as follows:
Controllers -> It is in charge of being the first contact of the REST API requests, in charge of routing and in this case adding data validation through the use of validationPipe, where the class-validator library is used to set the appropriate decorator for each input property in the dtos folders.
Services -> takes care of the business logic, in which you can add validation of specific cases other than the input data, and more requirement-specific behaviours 
Repository -> Here we will find in an organized way the requests to the database where its purpose would be to standardize and reuse the mentioned ones.

two folders were created across the whole application in order to be taken into account as a possible tool to use depending on the needs, in my work I like to emphasize the order of everything related to software development because as Barbara Hemphill said ‘Disorder is nothing more than postponed decisions’.

1 . We will add a small description of the value of the common folder in which we will find the enum constants and interfaces used to maintain a standard and a constant use at hand of possible types which can be reusable.

2. Secondly we will talk about the Guards folder in which we will find the code of the responsible for the endpoint security decorated with the annotation @UseGuards(AuthGuard) so the authentication token provided by the login service will be validated.

Finally, we will talk about the fact that for each entity complete CRUDs were created for the additional purpose of maintaining this need for companies to realise a complete system for all data.
